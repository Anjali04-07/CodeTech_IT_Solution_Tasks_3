This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple AI chatbot using Python and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to interact with users by accepting text input and providing appropriate responses based on predefined questions and keywords. It simulates a basic conversational system that can answer common user queries.

The chatbot processes user input by converting the text into lowercase and breaking it into individual words using tokenization. These tokens are then compared with stored patterns in a response dictionary. When a match is found, the chatbot returns the corresponding response. If the input does not match any known pattern, the chatbot responds with a default message indicating that the input was not understood.

The project is implemented entirely in Python and utilizes the NLTK library for natural language processing concepts. It runs in a command-line environment and continues interacting with the user until the exit command is given. This chatbot demonstrates fundamental NLP concepts such as text normalization, tokenization, and keyword-based intent matching.

This project is suitable for beginners who want to understand the basics of chatbot development and natural language processing. It can be further enhanced by adding more intents, integrating a graphical user interface, or using advanced NLP libraries for improved conversational accuracy.
